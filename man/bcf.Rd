\arguments{
\item{y}{Response variable}

\item{z}{Treatment variable}

\item{x_control}{Design matrix for the prognostic function mu(x)}

\item{x_moderate}{Design matrix for the covariate-dependent treatment effects tau(x)}

\item{pihat}{Length n estimates of propensity score}

\item{w}{An optional vector of weights. When present, BCF fits a model \eqn{y | x ~ N(f(x), \sigma^2 / w)}, where \eqn{f(x)} is the unknown function.}

\item{random_seed}{A random seed passed to R's set.seed}

\item{n_chains}{An optional integer of the number of MCMC chains to run}

\item{n_threads}{An optional integer of the number of threads to parallelize within chain bcf operations on}

\item{nburn}{Number of burn-in MCMC iterations}

\item{nsim}{Number of MCMC iterations to save after burn-in. The chain will run for nsim*nthin iterations after burn-in}

\item{nthin}{Save every nthin'th MCMC iterate. The total number of MCMC iterations will be nsim*nthin + nburn.}

\item{update_interval}{Print status every update_interval MCMC iterations}

\item{ntree_control}{Number of trees in mu(x)}

\item{power_control}{Power for the tree prior on mu(x) trees}

\item{ntree_moderate}{Number of trees in tau(x)}

\item{sd_moderate}{SD(tau(x)) marginally at any covariate value (or its prior median if use_tauscale=TRUE)}

\item{power_moderate}{Power for the tree prior on tau(x) trees (see details)}

\item{no_output}{logical, whether to suppress writing trees and training log to text files, defaults to FALSE.}

\item{save_tree_directory}{Specify where trees should be saved. Keep track of this for predict(). Defaults to working directory. Setting to NULL skips writing of trees.}

\item{log_file}{file where BCF should save its logs when running multiple chains in parallel. This file is not written too when only running one chain.}

\item{nu}{Degrees of freedom in the chisq prior on \eqn{sigma^2}}

\item{lambda}{Scale parameter in the chisq prior on \eqn{sigma^2}}

\item{sighat}{Calibration estimate for the chisq prior on \eqn{sigma^2}}

\item{include_pi}{Takes values "control", "moderate", "both" or "none". Whether to
include pihat in mu(x) ("control"), tau(x) ("moderate"), both or none. Values of "control"
or "both" are HIGHLY recommended with observational data.}

\item{use_muscale}{Use a half-Cauchy hyperprior on the scale of mu.}

\item{use_tauscale}{Use a half-Normal prior on the scale of tau.}

\item{verbose}{logical, whether to print log of MCMC iterations, defaults to TRUE.}

\description{
Fit Bayesian Causal Forests
}
\details{
Fits the Bayesian Causal Forest model (Hahn et. al. 2020): For a response
variable y, binary treatment z, and covariates x, we return estimates of mu, tau, and sigma in
the model
\deqn{y_i = \mu(x_i, \pi_i) + \tau(x_i, \pi_i)z_i + \epsilon_i}
where \eqn{\pi_i} is an (optional) estimate of the propensity score \eqn{\Pr(Z_i=1 | X_i=x_i)} and
\eqn{\epsilon_i \sim N(0,\sigma^2)}

Some notes:
\itemize{
   \item By default, bcf writes each sample (including the trees in the ensemble) for each chain to a text file, 
   which is used for prediction by the predict.bcf function. These text files may be large if bcf is run for many samples, 
   so we also provide an option to suppress this output by setting no_output = TRUE. If bcf is run with no_output = TRUE, 
   it will not be possible to predict from the model after the fact.
   \item x_control and x_moderate must be numeric matrices. See e.g. the makeModelMatrix function in the
   dbarts package for appropriately constructing a design matrix from a data.frame
   \item sd_control and sd_moderate are the prior SD(mu(x)) and SD(tau(x)) at a given value of x (respectively). If
   use_muscale = FALSE, then this is the parameter \eqn{\sigma_\mu} from the original BART paper, where the leaf parameters
   have prior distribution \eqn{N(0, \sigma_\mu/m)}, where m is the number of trees.
   If use_muscale=TRUE then sd_control is the prior median of a half Cauchy prior for SD(mu(x)). If use_tauscale = TRUE,
   then sd_moderate is the prior median of a half Normal prior for SD(tau(x)).
   \item By default the prior on \eqn{\sigma^2} is calibrated as in Chipman, George and McCulloch (2010).
